# Hey, I'm Adam.
Over the past 10 years I've been fortunate to hold a variety of positions in the cloud / security space. The first half was spent as an engineer, migrating applications, developing cloud native services, building environments, and securing ecosystems. The other half has been leading teams in similar domains.

My leadership style is people-centric. I believe in empowering my folks by equipping them with the tools and skills to be self-sufficient. Coaching and mentoring are core tenants of my work. I am currently enamored with AI. I believe this is the next revolution in computing and holds endless possibilities.

### Meyers-Briggs: INTJ (Architect)
 
Meyers-Briggs excerpt: 
_Architects value innovation and effectiveness more than just about any other quality. They are happy to throw aside the chain of command in favor of effective workflow, recognizing that artificial respect for their authority isn’t necessarily going to bring about good results. Solutions are more important than positions to this type. Whatever works rules the day for these managers.
 
Architects promote freedom and flexibility in the workplace, and they prefer to treat those who work for them as equals. They respect and reward proactive behavior. Their attitudes as managers can be summed up by the phrase, “To the best minds go the responsibilities.” They prefer to direct broader strategies while letting more hands-on workers manage day-to-day activities.
 
But this freedom isn’t just granted. It’s required. Those who are used to just being told what to do – who can’t direct themselves or challenge existing ideas – have a hard time meeting Architects’ high standard. Efficiency and results are kings to Architects, and behaviors that chip away at these standards are likely crushed. If workers attempt to make up for their poor results by trying to win their Architect boss over with flattery or social attention, they are likely to be disappointed. Those things rarely work with Architects._
